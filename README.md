This is a gobject wrapper for [HBCI4Java](https://github.com/willuhn/hbci4java/).

## Status

This is work in process. It's going to be the backend for the GUI application
gbank. Some basic functionality already is implemented, nevertheless be careful
when using this.

The API is not stable and will be extended as gbank grows.
